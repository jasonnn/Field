The Inspector
=============

The [inspector panel](http://localhost:10010/field/wiki/PaletteOverview#TheInspector) is where you can edit some of the properties of boxes. Simple things - like their position, size and name - will always appear here for anything that you select. Additional properties will sometimes be show (based on what kind of box it is) and can be added or removed from this list using that little '+' gadget. 

Furthermore you can add your own custom properties to this list - just add a property to a box that ends with '_i' and it will appear here so you can quickly edit it.

More information about properties and boxes [can be found here](http://localhost:10010/field/wiki/SelfAndProperties); properties can be used to for some [advanced tricks](http://localhost:10010/field/wiki/SelfAndProperties).
